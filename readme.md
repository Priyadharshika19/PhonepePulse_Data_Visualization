PhonePe-Pulse-Data-2018-2022-Analysis
I have created a dashboard to visualize Phonepe pulse Github repository data(https://github.com/PhonePe/pulse.git) using Streamlit and Plotly in Python


THE MAIN COMPONENTS OF DASHBOARD ARE

1 Extracting data from the Phonepe pulse Github repository and
cloning it

2 Transforming json data into table form and storing in database

3 Visualizing the following data  with the help of Plotly and Streamlit.
        * Aggrigated transaction
        * Aggrigated user
        * Geo-visualization of transaction
        * Geo-visualization of user
        * Top 10 districts according to transaction
        * Top 10 pincodes according to transaction
        * Top 10 districts according to user
        * Top 10 pincodes according to user
